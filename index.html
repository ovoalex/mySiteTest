<p> My name is Alex Lin. This is my first year at Cal Poly, I recently transferred from 
    Mt. Sac. I love watching basketball, my favorite team is the Lakers. Lately I had been playing video games, 
    going to the gym and napping. I recently finished playing <span>Ghost of Tsushima</span> and The Last of Us 2, 
    both of the games were really good and I would definitely recommend them if you haven't play them.
